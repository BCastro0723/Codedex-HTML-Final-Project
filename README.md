Hello! 

Welcome to Restaurant Menu. 
As part of an Intro to HTML course, I have been tasked with creating a Restaurant Menu. 
The project displays items from a fictional restaurant as well as allows users to learn and understand HTML fundamentals,
including articless, forms, elements, attributes and more. Additionally, some styling elements exist for understanding
how to enhance the overall look of the project within the same HTML file. 
The second half of the project includes the usage of labeled inputs, including number inputs with mins and maxes, 
textareas, checkboxes, and radios. The usage of these inputs are strictly informative and will not actually send
information anywhere yet (but possibly in a future project). 
I hope people new to HTML will take away some understanding of the markup language in hopes of helping with personal projects. 

Happy learning!
